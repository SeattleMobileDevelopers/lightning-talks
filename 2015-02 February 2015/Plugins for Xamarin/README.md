## What is a Plugin for Xamarin?
A special kind of NuGet that adds cross-platform functionality or abstracts platform specific functionality to a common API. These are both completely cross-platform and extremely small (i.e., they do 1 or 2 things really well with minimal to no dependencies). The plugin API can be accessed on each platform; however, most likely you will only use the common API in a Portable Class Library or Shared Code project. - See more at: http://motzcod.es/post/104507063997/what-exactly-is-a-plugin-for-xamarin

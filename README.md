Seattle Mobile .NET Developer Group Lightning Talks
========

Welcome to the Lighting Talks GitHub for the [Seattle Mobile .NET Developers Groups](http://www.meetup.com/SeattleMobileDevelopers/).

We will meet regularly to explore the use of .NET for building mobile applications. We will focus on multi-platform mobile development, including Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac, Windows Phone, and Windows 8.
